ðŸ“ˆ Automatically sync your Robinhood portfolio, trade history, and dividend data to Google Sheets.

---

Tired of the limited analytics in the Robinhood app? Sheet-My-Gains gives you the power to track your entire investment portfolio with the full flexibility of Google Sheets. This Google Apps Script fetches your holdings, order history, and dividend data, allowing you to create powerful, personalized dashboards and automate your financial tracking.

## Core Features:

* **Sync Positions**: Pull all your current stock, ETF, and crypto positions.
* **Fetch Order History**: Keep a complete log of your buy and sell orders.
* **Track Dividends**: Automatically log all dividend payouts.
* **Scheduled Triggers**: Set up the script to run automatically on a daily or hourly basis.
* **Fully Customizable**: Since the data is in your own Google Sheet, you can build any chart, formula, or report you can imagine.

## How to Add the App Script to Your Google Sheet:

To use Sheet-My-Gains, you'll need to add the provided Google Apps Script code to your Google Sheet:

1.  **Open your Google Sheet**: Go to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).
2.  **Access App Script**: From your spreadsheet, click `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.
3.  **Create a New Script**: A new Apps Script project will open in a new tab. If there's any default code (like `function myFunction() {}`), you can delete it.
4.  **Copy the Code**: Copy the entire content of the `sheet_my_gains.gs` file (provided in the `Sheet-My-Gains-initialization/Sheet-My-Gains/` directory) and paste it into the script editor, replacing any existing code.
5.  **Save the Script**: Click the floppy disk icon (Save project) or press `Ctrl + S` (Windows) / `Cmd + S` (Mac). You might be prompted to name your project; you can name it "Sheet-My-Gains" or anything you prefer.
6.  **Refresh Google Sheet**: Go back to your Google Sheet tab and refresh the page. You should now see a new "Robinhood" menu item in your spreadsheet.

## Available Functions:

Once the script is added, you can use the following functions directly in your Google Sheet cells as custom formulas, or interact with them via the "Robinhood" menu.

### Menu Functions:

* **`Robinhood` > `Login / Re-login`**:
    * **Purpose**: Initiates the interactive login process for your Robinhood account. This function clears any old access tokens and guides you through entering your credentials and handling any multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenges.
* **`Robinhood` > `Refresh Data`**:
